# Projects

Hello, my name is Alexandra Barrett, I am a sophmore studying Computer Science and Communications at the University of Minnesota.
I have posted various folders with projects that I have worked on in various programming languages for my classes.

In addition, below are links to a few websites that I am currently working on.

https://usadancencdc.org/ (complete other than continuing to make a few minior content updates)
This website is for the National Collegiate DanceSport Championships. This is a Ballroom Dance competition run by USA Dance. 
I restructured the website, found and implemented new media, and made content changes.

https://www.conversation-inc.org/ (basic formatting done, working to create donation interface)
This website is the Conversation, Inc. This is a nonprofit organization that is working to end homelessness, beginning in the Minneapolis area through one-on-one relationships. They believe giving homeless populations a human experience and genuine connection leads to stability and prosperity in their own life. Furthermore, they stand that a single conversation has lasting influence and the power to change someoneâ€™s life for the better.
I created the domain, email address, website, content, and am working to create donation interface.

https://danoc14.dreamhosters.com/comp/ (still in beginning stages, working with designer and waiting for content)
This website is to help ballroom dancers determine their proficiency level. Meaning, when a colligiate, amature, or professional dancer is signing up for their competitions they may want assistance determining what levels they should be dancing based on their past scores in compeitions. This website will search though all of this data and output each dancer's proficiency. In addition, the site will have a section for competiton directors in order for them to input all of the competitors at a compeition and cross check the levels that they should be dancing with the levels that they are actually dancing to ensure everyone is dancing at appropriate levels. I am in the beginning stages of meeting with the designer of the site and am waiting on our backend team for scripts that access old competiton data.
